• Teaching (especially secondary and university)
• Law
• Most government professional positions

• Agriculture (experience also valued)
• Entrepreneurship

**When Skills Matter More Than Degrees:**
• Software Development (portfolio > degree)

• Trades (Electrician, Plumber, Mechanic)
• Sales

**Alternatives to Traditional Degree:**

**1. Professional Certifications:**

**Best Strategy:**
• If you can afford university, go (opens most doors)
• If not, start with skills training
• Work and save for part-time degree later
• Or pursue professional certifications
• Build experience while studying

**Success Without Degree:**
• Many entrepreneurs succeed without degrees
• Tech field values skills over credentials
• Experience can substitute for education
• But be prepared to work harder to prove yourself

**Bottom Line:**
• Degree helps but isn't everything
• Skills + Experience + Network = Success
• Choose path that fits your situation
• You can always add education later`,
